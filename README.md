# Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Logic of Programming II course with Python, part of the Data Engineering specialization at Ada Tech School. The project involves the development of a financial control system that receives transactions and stores them in either a CSV or JSON file. The system is designed to perform various operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, as well as additional functionalities such as calculating investment returns and exporting reports.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Notebook

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/julioclerio/sistema_bancario_eng_dados_ada.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: sistema_bancario_eng_dados_ada.ipynb.

## Dataset

The project utilizes fictitious data for testing functionalities. The dataset includes information about transactions, including date, type (revenue, expenses, investment), value, and additional details for investment transactions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before running the project:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
